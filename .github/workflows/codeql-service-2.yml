# This workflow will trigger only when a file in the service-2 directory is edited.
#
# Make note of the following lines:
#  11 and 15: this tells the action when to run
#  41 and 42: This is the command to only build service 2
#  48: This is the category.  THIS IS SUPER IMPORTANT.  If you don't edit the category
#  the results will be overwritten when other services/directories are scanned
