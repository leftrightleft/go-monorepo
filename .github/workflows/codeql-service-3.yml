# This workflow will trigger only when a file in the service-3 directory is edited.
#
# Make note of the following lines:
#  11 and 15: this tells the action when to run
#  43 through 45: This tells codeql to only scan the code in the service-3 directory
#  51: This is the category.  THIS IS SUPER IMPORTANT.  If you don't edit the category
#  the results will be overwritten when other services/directories are scanned
